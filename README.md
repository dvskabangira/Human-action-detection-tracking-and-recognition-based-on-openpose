# Human detection, tracking and action recognition based on openpose
The recognition and detection of human actions pose challenges in computer vision due to issues such as background noise and partial occlusions.we leverage the powers of DNN(multilayer perceptron )algorithm for action classifiaction, Yolo for action detection, and the DeepSort algorithm for multi-people tracking. 
The occlusion problem is solved with Kalmanâ€™s filter implemented under the DeepSort algorithm.  
The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and reliable in recognizing and tracking multiple people with limited occlusion. 
This research has significant practical implications, paving the way for action recognition in real-world applications for surveillance systems
